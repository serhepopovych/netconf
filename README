Persistent network configuration (netconf) system using iproute2
================================================================

Netconf is a shell wrapper for iproute2 package ip(8) utility and their
subcommands line ip-link(8), ip-route(8) and ip-rules(8). It uses plain
text files stored in /netctl/etc/netconf/ subdirectories of specified
name and content format.

In general each line in config files used directly as command line to
corresponding ip(8) subcommand with only one exception forced that
requires network device (interface) name to be specified exactly at
first position in command line (i.e. en0_1="en0.1 up type vlan id 1").

Most of network device kinds (e.g. vlan, bond, gre, gretap, etc) already
supported by netconf and it is very easy to add new one when required.

There is support for routes and policy-based routing rules.

Virtual routers (based on ip-netns(8)) supporting custom ipset and
iptables rules supported, however their functionality is limited by
missing pid, uts and mount namespace isolation. Please consider using
container solutions like docker or lxc if it is necessary to run program
in virtual router network namespace.
