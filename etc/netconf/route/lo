# Need only when no support for ip-address(8) noprefixroute available to
# replace local type route with throw in local routing table to let
# routing lookup fall-through throw type route to next ip-rule(8) in
# policy-based routing list.
#
# By default that rule lookups in main routing table where more specific
# prefixes (e.g. /30, /32, etc) could point to exact circuit.
