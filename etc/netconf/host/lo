host_lo="@lo group loopback"

# Local broadcast addresses (and thus routes of broadcast type in local
# routing table, see output of ip -4 route show table local) cannot appear
# as source address of IP datagram header and thus will be discarded at
# ingress.
#
# To make whole subnet available (including reserved addresses) one might
# add broadcast address (all host part bits set) as /32 and then add subnet
# with network address as local.
#
# Above steps ensure that reserved addresses added as local type *before*
# automatically added by kernel broadcast type addresses when configuring
# subnet address.
#
# Following configuration can be used for NAT pools.
#
# *** Note that order of /32 and /X, where X is < 31, is important ***
