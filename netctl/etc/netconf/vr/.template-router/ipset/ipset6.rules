# Please pay attention to allocation of hash.
#
#  According to ipset(8) if IPSET netfilter target used to add entries in set,
#  the size of hashtable for hash:* types sets NOT changed (hash table will
#  not be reallocated with growing number of entries in a set). This
#  leads of hash clashes and performance degradation.
#
#  Also it is not feasible to have reallocations of hashtable with
#  number of entries growth as reallocation might fail (very unlikely!).
#
#  For high volume sets (like list of blocked addresses) it is recommended
#  to set hashsize to maxelem if enought free memory available.
#
# NOTE:
#    This file intended only for creation of ipset sets when no
#    such is configured in system. If you want to add custom *local*
#    data to ipset set consider adding it to local.d/<name_of_the_set>/*.txt
#    files.
